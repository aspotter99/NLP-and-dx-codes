The patient reported melanotic stools times 5\\nsince 4 p.m. on the day prior to admission. No hematemesis or\\nhematochezia. Stools were loose. The patient had a history of\\nmelena in [**2192-5-14**]. The patient also reported being\\nlightheaded, fatigued with an increase in his ch set\\ndiscomfort for which he was taking sublingual nitroglycerin\\nwith relief. On the a.m. of presentation, the symptoms\\npersisted; the patient contact[**Name (NI) **] his PCP who sent him to the\\n[**Name (NI) **]. In the ED, the p was found to have a hematocrit of 22.9\\ndecreased from a baseline of 32 to 38. He was given IV\\nProtonix, IV fluids, and transfused the first of 2 units of\\npacked red blood cells. Gastroenterology was consulted. The\\npatient initially had an EKG with slight inferior changes\\nwhile the patient was pain free. The patient then had an\\nepisode of [**9-23**] substernal chest pain in the ED with 3 to [**Street Address(2) 94587**] changes in V3 to V4.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for upper gastrointestinal\\nbleed in [**2192-5-14**]. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an\\nulcer in the pylorus and chronic gastritis, coronary artery\\ndisease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2179**] and [**2193**],\\nbenign prostatic hypertrophy, history of temporal arteritis,\\npemphigoid, history of anemia, history of small bowel\\nvolvulus, status post appendectomies, status post inguinal\\nhernia repair x2, history of colonic polyps, and sigmoid\\ndiverticulosis.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  The patient was on:\\n\\n1. Celebrex.\\n2. Aspirin.\\n3. Prednisone.\\n4. Atenolol.\\n5. Imdur.\\n6.

Initial CK was\\n107 with an MB of 6 and a troponin of 0.02. INR was 1.0.\\nUrinalysis was unremarkable. As stated above, the patient had\\n2 EKGs and the second of which showed 2 to [**Street Address(2) 5366**] changes in\\nV3 to V6. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary\\nprocess, so the patient was admitted to the hospital.\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE AS FOLLOWS:  GI: The\\npatient was felt to likely have another bleeding ulcer as the\\netiology of his melanotic stools and anemia. The patient had\\na history of Helicobacter pylori in the past that was\\ntreated. The patient was felt to require EGD to evaluate for\\nrecurrent infection as well as ongoing bleeding. The patient\\nwas initially admitted to the ICU. Gastroenterology was\\nconsulted. The patient was taken for EGD on [**6-13**], which\\nshowed a deep antral ulcer, no acute bleeding. The ulcer was\\ninjected.\\n\\nThe patient was initially continued on IV b.i.d. Protonix.\\nHematocrits were followed and the patient was maintained on 2\\nperipheral IV's at all times, and aspirin was held. The\\npatient has another episode of melanotic stool. On [**2194-6-14**],\\nhe was taken for another EGD, at that time which showed the\\nulcer was not bleeding. As a result, the patient was felt to\\nbe stable for discharge to home from a GI perspective with\\ncontinuation of the b.i.d. Protonix. The patient to follow up\\nfor a repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks as an outpatient.\\n\\nCardiac: Cardiac enzymes had been significant for elevated\\ntroponin on admission. Cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] who did not\\nrecommend cardiac catheterization or coronary artery bypass\\ngraft. The patient initially received heparin and was\\nrestarted on aspirin, which was approved by GI as long as the\\npatient had serial hematocrits. The patient was transfused to\\nkeep the hematocrit above 30. He was restarted on atenolol.\\nThe patient was also on Imdur for a longer-acting vasodilator\\neffect. The patient had a couple of episodes of further chest\\npain during the admission but had no further EKG changes.\\n\\nPulmonary: The patient had some desaturations to 70's and\\n80's with ambulation without improvement with oxygen with\\nambulation, but at this time the patient was completely\\nasymptomatic and the patient's oxygen saturation recovered\\nspontaneously to the high 90's on room air with rest. As a\\nresult, this was felt to possibly be not reflective of the\\npatient's pulmonary status, but reflective of some peripheral\\nvascular changes with ambulation. The patient was not felt to\\nneed inpatient workup and will follow up with PCP as an\\noutpatient.\\n\\nHematology: The patient with acute blood loss anemia,\\nreceived a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, had\\nserial hematocrits while on heparin gtt and was transfused to\\nkeep the hematocrit above 30.\\n\\nMusculoskeletal: The patient was restarted on his prednisone\\nfor polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.\\n\\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Gastric ulcer.\\nGastrointestinal bleed.\\nDemand ischemia, elevated troponins, and EKG changes in the\\nsetting of acute blood loss anemia.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n1.
