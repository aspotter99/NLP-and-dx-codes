If there is clinical concern for acalculous\\ncholecystitis, HIDA scan is recommended.\\n2.  Splenomegaly.\\n\\nHIDA ([**7-20**]): Lack of tracer activity in the gallbladder is\\nconsistent with acute cholecystitis.\\n\\nU/S ABDOMEN ([**7-20**]):\\n1.  The gallbladder is distended and contains a large volume of\\nsludge.  There are no obstructing calculi identified.  No\\ngallbladder wall thickening to suggest inflammatory etiology.\\nHowever, if there is ongoing clinical concern for cholecystitis,\\na HIDA scan is recommended.\\n2.  The spleen measures 14 cm, decreased compared to the\\nprevious ultrasound.\\n\\nU/S ABDOMEN ([**8-20**]):\\n1.  Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube remains in place within a\\ndecompressed gallbladder without evidence of adjacent fluid\\ncollection.\\n2.  Splenomegaly.\\n3.

PICC repositioned, but consistently has\\nproblems drawing back requiring tPA.\\n[**8-26**]: progression of multifocal pneumonia noted on Chest CT\\n[**9-5**]: stable multifocal pneumonia, stable b/l pleural effusions\\n\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n=\\n================================================================\\n#) ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA: Found to have WBC of 99,000 at OSH\\ninitially, and on examination of peripheral smear, found to have\\n96% blasts, no Auer rods. Heme/onc was consulted from the ED.\\nGiven the degree of leukocytosis, he was started on hydroxyurea\\novernight. He had bone marrow done on [**2128-3-25**].  Started on 7+3\\non [**2128-3-26**].  Given persistence of disease based on bone marrow\\nbiopsy on [**2128-4-8**], he completed 5+2 regimen. Repeat biopsy still\\nshowed residual biopsy. Thus, he completed another round of\\nchemotherapy (MEC D1C1 [**2128-5-15**]) after which repeat biopsy\\nrevealed that the bone marrow had been ablated.  Pt remained\\npersistently neutropenic.  The bone marrow remained acellular on\\nrepeat BMBx on [**2128-6-29**] with no leukemic cells. He was\\ntransplanted with double cord blood on [**2128-7-30**].  Persistently\\nneutropenic on filgrastim until WBC counts began to recover\\n[**2128-8-12**] to > 0.1 and continued to uptrend to 2.5 by [**8-27**].\\n\\n#) COLITIS:  IV flagyl was initiated on [**4-4**] and CT abdomen\\nshowed colitis on [**2128-4-6**]. Stool Cdiff negative and noro\\nnegative. Lower Abd tender but soft and better than prior\\n(diffuse tenderness) and improving. KUB not concerning. CMV VL\\nnot detected. Repeat CT on [**2128-4-13**] shows improvement in colitis,\\nand stools decreased to 1 per day and no BM over the last 4\\ndays.  Repeat CT scan on [**6-7**] showed resolution of previously\\nseen colitis.  Despite this improvement pt still had much\\ndifficulty taking in po\\'s.  Etiology of lack of po intake is\\nlikely multifactorial.  While he did complain of \"occasional\"\\nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, he also felt a lack of\\nmotivation and \"decreased taste\" for food.  Consulted psychiatry\\non [**6-11**], who recommended starting mirtazapine qhs for appetite\\nand sleep, which was started but then discontinued on [**6-13**] given\\nconcern for increased somnolence.  TPN was discontinued on [**6-23**]\\nin an attempt to stimulate appetite.  He was also started on a\\ncalorie count and ritalin on [**6-24**].  Ritalin increased to [**Hospital1 **]\\ndosing on [**6-25**].  Pt did ~300Kcal/day on calorie count and\\nreceived Megace for appetite stimulation. TPN was not restarted.\\nFlagyl and megace eventually discontinued, but meropenem\\ncontinued in setting of persistent neutropenia.\\n\\n#) FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA: Patient had low grade temperature on\\nadmission, and continued to have temperatures in 99-100s. He was\\ninitially started on Cefepime ([**2128-3-25**]) for febrile neutropenia\\n(WBC was high, but had 0% neutrophils) without improvement in\\nhis fever curve.\\n\\nFEVER CLUSTER #1 - Vancomycin was added on [**2128-3-26**] for continued\\nlow grade temperature. Blood cultures and urine cultures were\\nsent with no growth. CXR showed some suggestion of LLL\\ninfiltrate. Vancomycin was discontinued [**4-10**] given no fevers.\\n\\nFEVER CLUSTER #2 - Vancomycin was added on [**6-8**] and fungal\\ncoverage was broadened to Ambisome on [**6-9**] given subpleural based\\nopacity and multiple pulmonary nodules.  Based on CT scan, pt\\nunderwent bronch with BAL on [**6-10**] (no growth).  Daptomycin\\nconverted to vancomycin for increased lung penetration.  Flagyl\\nrestarted on [**6-15**] given persistent fevers.  Vancomycin was DC\\'d\\non [**6-25**] as pt was persistently afebrile and acyclovir was DC\\'d\\non [**6-29**] for the same reason.  Ambisome was DC\\'d on [**7-2**] when\\nrepeat chest CT showed improvement of nodules.\\n\\nFEVER CLUSTER #3 - Spiked fever again on [**8-9**] and ultimately grew\\nVRE from blood and biliary source.  Perc chole tube placed [**8-9**].\\nEssentially spiking daily fevers from [**Date range (2) 110434**]. Comparison\\nof Chest CTs from [**8-20**] and [**8-26**] showed interval worsening of\\nmultifocal pneumonia and right side pleural effusion. Of note,\\nthe patient\\'s WBC count has been within normal limits from\\n[**Date range (1) **]. Repeat echocardiogram on [**8-31**] showed no valvular\\nabnormalities suggestive of endocarditis, EF >55%. Repeat Chest\\nCT [**2128-9-5**] showed little interval change.\\n\\n#) ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline creatinine 1.0.\\n[**Last Name (un) **] #1: Cr elevated to 1.9 on [**6-25**] from baseline of 1.0.\\nEtiology was likely multifactorial including dehydration from\\ndiscontinuation of TPN/poor po intake and multiple nephrotoxic\\nmedications (vancomycin, ambisome and acyclovir).  Vanc trough\\nwas elevated to 25.7 and therefore evening dose on [**6-25**] was\\nheld.\\n\\n[**Last Name (un) **] #2: Creatinine increasing around [**8-18**] after VRE grew from\\nblood likely sepsis related with peak at 2.0.  Gentamycin\\nstarted for synergy which likely worsened [**Last Name (un) **] but eventually\\ndowntrended back to baseline on IVF.\\n\\n#) ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Found to have HCT of 10% on\\nadmission. Thought to be due to bone marrow suppression from\\nleukemia, as patient did not have elevated bilirubin or other\\nlaboratory findings to suggest hemolysis.  S/p _______ units of\\nblood and ________ units of platelets.  Has refractory\\nthrombocytopenia likely [**2-5**] splenomegaly and alloimunization.\\nThere was concern for autoantibodies to platelets but PRA\\ntesting was negative.\\n\\n#) ACUTE CHOLECYSTITIS: Diagnosed with acute cholecystits on\\nHIDA after gallbladder U/S read as intermediate. No obstructing\\nstone was found. As pt improved clinically with minimal RUQ and\\nable to tolerate PO intake, decision made to forego surgical\\ninterventio in setting of pancytopenia. LFT\\'s and clinical\\nstatus monitored daily. Patient received biliary drain placement\\non [**8-9**] as non-operative intervention for cholecystitis.  General\\nsurgery saw patient, felt patient needed cholecystectomy but not\\na good surgical candidate. General surgery reevaluated the\\npatient on [**9-1**] and commented that the perc chole is draining\\nwell; cholecystectomy not indicated at this time due to poor\\nhealth status and other foci of infection.\\n\\n#) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient transferred to MICU on [**8-20**]\\ndue to altered mental status in setting of initiating\\ngranulocyte infusion, supratherapeutic tacrolimus level to 12,\\nand difficulty caring for patient on the floor.  Patient not\\nfollowing commands and alert and oriented only to self. Mental\\nstatus was thought to be secondary to toxic / metabolic in\\nsetting of previously untreated VRE sepsis as well as\\ncontributing hepatic encelopathy [**2-5**] shock liver, potential\\nobstruction.  Lactulose was started.  Neurology was consulted\\nbecause of dysarthria and weakness on exam. EEG was performed,\\nwhich was not consistent with seizures. Weakness was thought to\\nbe proximal, likely due to myopathy.  Consideration was also\\npaid to potential role of tacrolimus, levels of which were\\nsignificantly elevated during [**Last Name (un) **].  Tacro was held. Patient\\'s\\nmental status improved over course of MICU stay, with patient\\nbeing oriented to person, place, time and transferred back to\\nBMT floor. While on the BMT floor the patient\\'s mental status\\nwaxed and waned. A repeat MRI head was done on [**9-1**] which showed\\nsmall vessel disease, but no acute process. An incidental\\nfinding of asymmetric mastoid air cell enhancement raised the\\nquestion of supperative mastoiditis. ENT was consulted and thin\\ncut CT of the sinuses was performed. No bony erosion was evident\\nand therefore no ENT intervention needed.   Improvement in\\nmental status was noted with the the onset of less frequent\\nfevers and decreased morphine basal dose on PCA. Repeat EEG was\\nperformed on [**2128-9-4**].\\n\\nICU Issues:\\n================\\n62yo M with refractory AML admitted on [**3-24**] and now s/p double\\ncord SCT on [**2128-7-30**]. Hospital course complicated by biliary\\nsepsis, respiratory failure, and encephalopathy. In [**Month (only) 216**], had\\nsevere biliary sepsis (not choly candidate, so perc tube\\nplaced). Since [**Month (only) **], had course c/b fungal pna, CMV viremia,\\nmental status changes (thought to be due to PRES [**2-5**]\\ncyclosporine). Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] ([**9-10**] - [**9-17**]) for respiratory\\nfailure and hypotension. Readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-11**] - [**10-17**] for\\nbiliary sepsis/peritonitis and hypoxic respiratory distress post\\nERCP stent placement procedure on [**10-11**].\\n\\n# Course prior to patient\\'s death: Mr. [**Known lastname 74075**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] during\\nmorning of [**10-17**]. Interdisciplinary meeting held with BMT, ICU,\\nID, ERCP, IR, Surgery, and SW on [**10-15**] to discuss management of\\nbiliary sepsis as patient was deteriorating. His mental status\\nwas worsening, Tbilis trending up, increasing abdominal pain and\\ndistention, worsening sepsis despite broad coverage antibiotics\\nand antifungals. Decision was made to intubate the patient and\\ngo for a CT guided paracentesis and perc chole drain\\ninterrogation study with IR. Paracentesis showed that fluid in\\nthe abdomen was bile   and the tube interrogation demonstrated\\nthat bile was leaking into the peritoneum  and that the perc\\ntube was displaced and terminating anterior to the liver. On\\n[**10-17**] 0000, patient had fever and became hypotensive in the\\n77-80s requiring three different pressors (vasopressin,\\nphenylephrine, and NE) at maxed doses. Labs showed increasing\\nlactic acid with severe metabolic acidosis. He was given 150 of\\nbicarb in hopes that pressors effectiveness would improve. His\\nvent settings was changed to pressure support to allow him to\\nincrease his respirations and help decrease his acidosis.\\nContinued to be hypotensive in the 80s and given 2L LR boluses.\\n[**Name (NI) 553**] (girlfriend and HCP) updated and she arrived with her\\nsister to the patient\\'s bedside at 0245. Patient\\'s pressures\\nheld in the 70s-80s (MAP ~50), but he was unresponsive. Code\\nstatus was discussed with [**Doctor First Name 553**] and she decided to not\\nresuscitate. Patient [**Doctor First Name **] at approximately 0830.\\n\\n# Hypotension/Sepsis:\\nInitially transferred to ICU for likely septic shock. Lactate\\nwas low at 0.3 and continues to be low at 0.7. Pt spiked a fever\\nto 102F on [**2128-9-10**] and no fevers since. Source appears to be\\nbiliary VSE. Pt had suspicion of multifocal pneumonia with\\nunclear pathogen but Pt has been on broad abx coverage. Pt\\npreviously had acute cholecystitis with VSE and also VRE\\nbacteremia of unclear source in early [**Name (NI) 216**]. He had a\\npercutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed. His blood cultures\\nhave been negative since then but a repeat bile culture from\\n[**8-31**] again grew vanc sensitive enterococcus. And bile\\ncultures from [**9-10**] is growing rare enterococcus in aerobic vile.\\nEcho did not show evidence of endocarditis on [**8-31**]. His\\nurine cultures have remained negative. He had an MRI brain on\\n[**9-1**] that did not show any evidence of acute infection. He\\nhas not had an LP due to severe thrombocytopenia. Culture of\\nPICC tip removed on [**9-1**] yielded no growth. He does not have any\\ndiarrhea or leukocytosis, and his C diff stool PCR was negative\\non [**2128-9-7**], but he seems to have significant abdominal pain. CT\\n[**9-11**] showed no intrabdominal abscess but mild edema of the colon\\nc/w volume overload vs colitis/typhilitis and stable bilateral\\npleural effusions.  Despite his large pleural effusions,\\nthrombocytopenia has made prior teams hesitant to pursue\\nthoracentesis. Radiology also feels these are not empyemas. PE\\nremains a possibility but LENIs negative.  Currently off of\\npressors. Another explanation for his hypotension may be adrenal\\ninsufficiency given random cortisol of 8.6 which is\\ninappropriately low given current severe illness. VSE grown in\\nbile cx found to be sensitive to daptomycin. His mental status\\nimproved with continued treatment and given his prior RUQ pain,\\nsuspect biliary souce w/ possible biliary sepsis. No organisms\\ngrew probably because he was on very broad antibiotic coverage.\\n\\nPt tranferred back to the floor but returned to the ICU on [**10-11**]\\nfor biliary sepsis post ERCP procedure where stent was placed to\\nredirect bile from gallbladder to the bowel. He was continued on\\nzosyn, dapto, micafungin, and bactrim ppx per ID\\nrecommendations. Vanco was also added the following day. Zosyn\\nwas switched to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] for broader coverage. His bilirubin and alk\\nphos continued to trend up despite the stent placement. Tbilis\\nfrom 4 to 12.2 and alk phos from 200s to 790s. Lipase was\\nelevated in the 300s. Patient also had worsening abdominal pain\\nand distention.\\n\\n# Acute respiratory failure: Pt extubated successfully on [**9-15**].\\nPt suffered acute respiratory distress. Pt\\'s ABG showed CO2\\nretention and hypoxia. Unclear etiology, but likely due to\\nsepsis and was very broadly covered with abx as above.\\nBronchoscopy did not show obvious pathology and BAL cultures are\\npending. CT scan shows stable to slightly increased bilateral\\npleural effusions and interval increase of parenchymal\\natelectasis vs consolidation at bases, no evidence of empyema.\\nThoracentesis contraindicated given bleeding risk with\\nthrombocytopenia. RSBI 27, satting well on PEEP 5, RAS -1.\\n\\nWhen patient returned to the ICU on [**10-11**] post ERCP, he was kept\\nintubated due to tachypnea and tachycardic pre-procedure. He was\\nable to be succesfully extubated in a few hours and kept on\\nfacemask. Hypoxic respiratory distress was thought to be\\nsecondary to sepsis. He was continued to be broadly covered for\\npossible pneumonia with micafungin, bactrim ppx, dapto, and\\n[**Last Name (un) 2830**]. CXR did not show any signs of consolidation. There is also\\ncontribution from pain and distended abdomen pressing on lungs\\nand causing respiratory distress. His pain was treated with\\ndilaudid.\\n\\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: on [**10-11**], his creatinine noted to rise up to 3.4. Thought\\nto be multifactorial including ATN/prerenal secondary to sepsis\\nand AIN secondary to CMV and/or meds (foscarnet). CPK was\\nchecked and was 14. Renal was consulted and thought it was\\nlikely due to ischemic renal insult without frank ATN. Continued\\nto fluid resuscitate as needed. All medications were also\\nrenally dosed.\\n\\n# cholecystitis/biliary leakage/biliary peritonitis:\\npercutaneous tube placed on [**8-/2128**] given that patient was not\\ncandidate for cholecystectomy. Drain put out about >1L per day\\nand there was concern for nutritional and medication losses in\\nbile. Initially, patient had intermittent RUQ pain but CT\\nabd/pelvis and RUQ u/s showed no biliary dilation or other acute\\nintraabdominal pathology likely responsible for pain. A HIDA\\nscan on [**10-11**] showed CBD obstruction and patient sent for ERCP\\nand placement of stent. He was continued on ursodiol.\\n\\n#AML: Pt is s/p double cord allo transplant with evidence of\\nengraftment. Pt previously unable to tolerate PO meds and was\\ntransitioned from tacto to cyclosporine IV. Cyclosporine has\\nbeen adjusted multiple times for elevated levels (goal 200).\\nFish XY test was sent to test if blood cells were from engrafted\\nXX cord transplant. Result showed that patient had 70% xx and\\n30% xy suggestive of possible recurrence of AML.  He continued\\nimmunosupression with mychophenolate and cyclosporine.\\nCyclosporine levels were checked daily. BMT team was following\\nthroughout stay at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].\\n\\n# thrombocytopenia: ranging from 11-20s. PTT, PT, fibrinogen\\n377, LDH 274 not suggestive of DIC. Likely multifactorial\\nincluding zosyn, possibly developing antibodies against\\nplatelets, bone marrow suppression from infection, and AML.\\nPatient with no signs of bleeding.\\n\\n# CMV Viremia: CMV viral load 31,000 <-- 11,500 ([**9-29**]) <--\\n10,900 ([**9-27**]) <-- 8,100 ([**9-23**]) <-- 2,640 ([**9-20**]). CMV IgG\\npositive. Initially on gancyclovir but viral load continued to\\nrise and was switched to Foscarnet, which was renally dosed.\\n\\n# PRES: diagnosed on MRI head on [**9-30**] and emperically treated\\nfor HSV encephalitis. EEG on [**9-4**] with no seizure activity. Per\\nBMT team, thought secondary to tacrolimus and switched to\\ncyclosporine. BMT team also states that patient\\'s mental status\\nhas significantly improved and is now alert and oriented x3,\\nable to carry conversation. Cyclosporine was titrated to goal of\\n200. His fluid status was optimized. Patient appeared to have\\ngood mental status (A&Ox3 and able to carry conversations) from\\n[**Date range (1) 100888**], then deteriorated secondary to sepsis.\\n\\n# Hypernatremia: [**Month (only) 116**] be related to free water losses in setting\\nof sepsis. Repleted water deficit slowly and sodium corrected.\\n\\n# Metabolic acidosis: initially he had a non-anion gap acidosis\\nwith hyperchloremia, likely due to free water depletion and\\nconcomitant hypovolemia.\\n\\n# anemia: in the low 20s but appears to be chronic. Indirect\\nbili 0.9 and haptoglobin 212, thus unlikely to be hemolysis.\\nMost likely multifactorial including ACD, immunosuppresants, and\\nbone marrow suppression. Hct was monitored daily with a\\ntransfusion goal of hct<21\\n\\n#Hypogammaglobulinemia: The pt\\'s IgG level from [**9-15**] was low in\\nthe 500 range.

Pt was seen by neurology,\\nwho recent signed off and felt delirium was the most likely\\nexplanation. Mental status has greatly improved therefore we\\nwill not pursue LP at this time given bleeding risk with\\nthrombocytopenia, although ID recommends further workup rather\\nthan keeping on high dose acyclovir due to fear of inducing\\nrenal failure given Pt is also on ambisome and cyclosporine.\\nSuspect component of delirium given rapid waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].\\nDoubt HSV encephalitis given rapid changes in condition.
