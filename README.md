# Introduction 

Hospitals depend on having accurate medical coding that reflects all events in a patient encounter from the time of admission to discharge.  Coding inaccuracies can cause claim denials and result in lost revenue for a hospital.  

# Goal 
This project aims to use Natural Language Processing to correctly predict an ICD-10 code using physician notes from a patient's medical record. 

# Data Set
Data used in this project was obtained from
